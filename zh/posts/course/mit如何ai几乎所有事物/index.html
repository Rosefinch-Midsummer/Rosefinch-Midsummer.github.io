Course Description
Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds great promise as a technology to enhance digital productivity, physical interactions, overall well-being, and the human experience. To enable the true impact of AI, these systems will need to be grounded in real-world data modalities, from language-only systems to vision, audio, sensors, medical data, music, art, smell, and taste. This course will introduce the basic principles of AI (focusing on modern deep learning and foundation models) and how we can apply AI to novel real-world data modalities. In addition, we will introduce the principles of multimodal AI that can process many modalities at once, such as connecting language and multimedia, music and art, sensing and actuation, and more."><meta name=author content="RM"><link rel=canonical href=https://rosefinch-midsummer.github.io/zh/posts/course/mit%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95ai%E5%87%A0%E4%B9%8E%E6%89%80%E6%9C%89%E4%BA%8B%E7%89%A9/><script async src=//busuanzi.ibruce.info/busuanzi/2.3/busuanzi.pure.mini.js></script><meta name=referrer content="no-referrer-when-downgrade"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.2211ca3164be7830024f6aad2b3a2e520843a64f8f048445c3401c1249aa051d.css integrity="sha256-IhHKMWS+eDACT2qtKzouUghDpk+PBIRFw0AcEkmqBR0=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://rosefinch-midsummer.github.io/img/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://rosefinch-midsummer.github.io/img/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://rosefinch-midsummer.github.io/img/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://rosefinch-midsummer.github.io/img/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://rosefinch-midsummer.github.io/img/android-chrome-192x192.png><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=zh href=https://rosefinch-midsummer.github.io/zh/posts/course/mit%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95ai%E5%87%A0%E4%B9%8E%E6%89%80%E6%9C%89%E4%BA%8B%E7%89%A9/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.1/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-R4558gYOUz8mP9YWpZJjofhk+zx0AS11p36HnD2ZKj/6JR5z27gSSULCNHIRReVs crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.1/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-z1fJDqw8ZApjGO3/unPWUPsIymfsJmyrDVWC8Tv/a1HeOtGmkwNd/7xUS0Xcnvsx crossorigin=anonymous></script><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.1/dist/contrib/auto-render.min.js integrity=sha384-+XBljXPPiv+OzfbB3cVmLHf4hdUFHlWNZN5spNQ7rmHTXpd7WvJum6fIACpNNfIR crossorigin=anonymous></script><script>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){renderMathInElement(document.body,{delimiters:[{left:"$$",right:"$$",display:!0},{left:"$",right:"$",display:!1},{left:"\\(",right:"\\)",display:!1},{left:"\\[",right:"\\]",display:!0}],throwOnError:!1})})</script><meta property="og:url" content="https://rosefinch-midsummer.github.io/zh/posts/course/mit%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95ai%E5%87%A0%E4%B9%8E%E6%89%80%E6%9C%89%E4%BA%8B%E7%89%A9/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="天漢帝國復興錄"><meta property="og:title" content="MIT《如何AI（几乎）所有事物》"><meta property="og:description" content="MIT How to AI(Almost) Everything 前言 本门课程主要讲的是多模态大模型，而不是AI应用方式。

Simple ones can be used as baselines. How to Debug Your Model Look at the data first. Is the input data \u0026 label correct? Ensure no data leakage; Look at the outputs. Is model only predicting one label? Label imbalance: Data Augmentation; loss scaling Look at the training loss Loss is nan: Inspect weights and inputs for NaN values. Make sure weights are initialized. LLM: Use bfloat16 instead of float16. Loss not changing: Model underfitting. Increase learning rate; decrease weight decay; Add more complexity; Use better optimizer*. Look at Loss (Continued) Loss highly varied/increasing: Decrease learning rate; Gradient Clipping; Use better Optimizers Look at train vs val accuracy (or any other metrics) Train » Val: Model overfitting. More weight decay, reduce model complexity, data augmentation, get more data Train ≈ Val ≈ 100%: Check for data leakage Personal tip: I recommend trying second order optimizers from packages like Heavyball\nCommon model architectures Lecture Outline\nA unifying paradigm of model architectures Temporal sequence models Spatial convolution models Models for sets and graphs Summary: How To Model\nDecide how much data to collect, and how much to label (costs and time) Clean data: normalize/standardize, find noisy data, anomaly/outlier detection Visualize data: plot, dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-sne), cluster analysis Decide on evaluation metric (proxy + real, quantitative and qualitative) Choose modeling paradigm - domain-specific vs general-purpose Figure out base elements and their representation Figure out data invariances \u0026 equivariances (+other parts of modality profile) Iterate between data collection, model design, model training, hyperparameter tuning etc. until satisfied.

href=#course-description>#</a></h2><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds great promise as a technology to enhance digital productivity, physical interactions, overall well-being, and the human experience. To enable the true impact of AI, these systems will need to be grounded in real-world data modalities, from language-only systems to vision, audio, sensors, medical data, music, art, smell, and taste. This course will introduce the basic principles of AI (focusing on modern deep learning and foundation models) and how we can apply AI to novel real-world data modalities. In addition, we will introduce the principles of multimodal AI that can process many modalities at once, such as connecting language and multimedia, music and art, sensing and actuation, and more.</p><p>Through lectures, readings, discussions, and a significant research component, this course will develop critical thinking skills and intuitions when applying AI to new data modalities, knowledge of recent technical achievements in AI, and a deeper understanding of the AI research process.</p><h2 id=course-info>Course Info<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#course-info>#</a></h2><h5 id=instructor>Instructor<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#instructor>#</a></h5><ul><li><a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?q=Prof.+Paul+Liang">Prof. Paul Liang</a></li></ul><h5 id=departments>Departments<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#departments>#</a></h5><ul><li><a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?d=Media+Arts+and+Sciences">Media Arts and Sciences</a></li></ul><h1 id=content>Content<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#content>#</a></h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>Multisensory intelligence: Creating human-AI symbiosis across scales and sensory mediums to enhance productivity, creativity, and wellbeing.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://setsailtowardstianhan.ip-ddns.com/blog/6efcb9a36aa9717f5385c1ae0f9d7441.png></p><h3 id=course-overview>Course Overview<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#course-overview>#</a></h3><ol><li>AI for new modalities: data, modeling, evaluation, deployment</li><li>Multimodal AI: connecting multiple different data sources</li></ol><h3 id=learning-objectives>Learning Objectives<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#learning-objectives>#</a></h3><ol><li>Study recent technical achievements in AI research</li><li>Improve critical and creative thinking skills</li><li>Understand future research challenges in AI</li><li>Explore and implement new research ideas in AI</li></ol><h3 id=preferred-pre-requisites>Preferred Pre-requisites<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#preferred-pre-requisites>#</a></h3><ol><li>Some knowledge of programming (ideally in Python)</li><li>Some basic understanding of modern AI capabilities & limitations</li><li>Bring external (non-AI) domain knowledge about your problem</li><li>Bonus: worked on AI for some modality</li></ol><h3 id=research-projects-on-new-modalities>Research Projects on New Modalities<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#research-projects-on-new-modalities>#</a></h3><p>Motivation: Many tasks of real-world impact go beyond image and text.</p><p>Challenges:</p><ul><li>AI with non-deep-learning effective modalities (e.g., tabular, time-series)</li><li>Multimodal deep learning + time-series analysis + tabular models</li><li>AI for physiological sensing, IoT sensing in cities, climate and environment sensing</li><li>Smell, taste, art, music, tangible and embodied systems</li></ul><p>Potential models and dataset to start with</p><ul><li>Brain EEG Signal: <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16934>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16934</a></li><li>Speech: <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02050.pdf>https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02050.pdf</a></li><li>Facial Motion: <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10897>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10897</a></li><li>Tactile: <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.00117.pdf>https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.00117.pdf</a></li></ul><h3 id=research-projects-on-ai-reasoning>Research Projects on AI Reasoning<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#research-projects-on-ai-reasoning>#</a></h3><p>Motivation: Robust, reliable, interpretable reasoning in (multimodal) LLMs.</p><p>Challenges:</p><ul><li>Fine-grained and compositional reasoning</li><li>Neuro-symbolic reasoning</li><li>Emergent reasoning in foundation models</li></ul><p>Potential models and dataset to start with</p><ul><li>Can LLMs actually reason and plan?</li><li>Code for VQA: CodeVQA: <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05392.pdf>https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05392.pdf</a>, VisProg:
